The per capita Income data set is for Linear Regression Final 1. Have used vectorized approach to make the model.

For Linear Regression Final 2 I havent used any external datasets, created the arrays on my own. Used Gradient  Descent to build the model.

The heart disease data set is for LogisticRegression.

Have not used any external libraries such  as sklearn, only used numpy and pandas.
